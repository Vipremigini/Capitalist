# Capitalist 
This is supposed to be a RPG game. this will be a business simulator where players can start businesses. Buy stocks, sell stuff and a lot more. this game is definitely inspired by the bag, but I plan to be running parallel to it and see where it gets me.

## stock market
In the stock market, part of the game, players can buy virtual game stocks of companies. which they can use to invest their money in, or they can sell it to other players in the game.
The prices of the stocks will be determined either by the real-time value of that specific stock, or I will implement custom game companies and determine their value by using a random function.
This will act as an investment mechanic for the players in the game.

## properties
In the game, players can buy multiple properties, which will act as an investment for them.
They can increase the valuation of the property by renovating it and upgrading it .
They can sell their properties to other player.
 they will have to sell a property to settle the debt if they get into one.

## businesses
Businesses will serve as money generating entity in the game
Players can start a business or buy a business from another player, and these businesses will generate a set amount of money for them in a set amount of time.
Players can sell their businesses to other players on their own terms and on their own price.
These businesses will be able to generate money, and the players can upgrade their businesses to generate more money.
Having certain businesses will unlock certain achievements and knowledge for the player which they can use to start another businesses or develop new products

## marketplace
In this entity of the game, the players can sell items to each other.
This will be a regulated marketplace to control the prices and economy. it will be controlled by an group of people named the capitalist council, which will dictate the prices and will approve the items to be sold on the marketplace.
